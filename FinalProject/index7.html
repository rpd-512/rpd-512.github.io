            <h1>Pollution</h1>
            <h3>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. <br>
                Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. <br>
                Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.</h3>
            <h2>There are 3 main types of Pollutions.</h2>
            <h3>Air Pollution, Water Pollution and Land Pollution</h3></div>

            <h3>Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings,
                or cause damage to the climate or to materials.<br>
                There are different types of air pollutants, such as gases, particulates, and biological molecules.</h3></div>

            <h3>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, 
                lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.</h3></div>

            <h1>Land Pollution</h1>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Litter.JPG/310px-Litter.JPG">
            <h3>Soil contamination or soil pollution as part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotics chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment.<br>
                It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste.</h3></div>

            <h3>Only if we start to take more care of our mother planet, we can preserve the earch for a really long time.<br>
                We should all plant a tree whenever we can stop littering and user recyclable goods for our daily use.<br>
                Lets save the earth before its too late.</h3>
